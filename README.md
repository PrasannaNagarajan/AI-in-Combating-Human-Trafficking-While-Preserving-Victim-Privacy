# AI-in-Combating-Human-Trafficking-While-Preserving-Victim-Privacy
This is a project for Class CMPINF 1205


This Repository is made to inform people about the growing issue with people abusing the AI that is used for saving people that have been human trafficked by stealing the data that have been collected on them, which is used to save them. The data collected is now being used against the victims who have already been heavily affected.

A proposal is first being written and I will later attach the final paper once I have finished with it.

I will also try to maybe make a program that can help combat this.
